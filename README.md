Simplexer is a simple simplex calculator for images.

# Image Topological Analysis Web App

Simplexer allows you to upload images and perform topological data analysis using the GUDHI library. It generates simplicial complex representations and computes topological features such as Betti numbers.

## Features

- Image upload functionality
- Simplicial complex generation from images
- Computation of Betti numbers
- Visualization of persistence barcodes and diagrams
- Web-based interface for easy interaction
